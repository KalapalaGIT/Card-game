# üÉè AI Card Game

Welcome to the **AI Card Game** repository! This project is a strategic card game where players face off against an AI opponent in a head-to-head battle of wits. With an intuitive user interface, you can see your cards, plan your moves, and try to outsmart the AI.

## üåü Project Vision

The vision for this project is to create an engaging and challenging card game experience that brings the excitement of traditional card games into the digital world. The core ideas behind this project include:

1. **AI-Driven Gameplay**:
   - The AI is designed to offer a competitive experience, utilizing various strategies to challenge the player. As the project evolves, the AI will adapt its strategies based on the player's moves, making each game unique.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - A seamless and visually appealing UI to enhance the gaming experience. Players will have a clear view of their cards, possible moves, and feedback from the game, making it easy to understand and enjoy.

3. **Customizable Game Modes**:
   - Future updates may include different game modes or rule sets, allowing players to customize their gameplay experience and try out new challenges.

4. **Learning and Strategy**:
   - The game aims to not only entertain but also encourage players to think strategically. By playing against the AI, users can sharpen their decision-making skills and learn new tactics.

## üîÆ Future Plans

As the project progresses, we have some exciting features in mind:

- **Enhanced AI Logic**: Implementing machine learning techniques to make the AI smarter and more adaptive.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Adding the ability to play with friends in real-time.
